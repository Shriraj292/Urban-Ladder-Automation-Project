## Test Automation Framework

### Overview

The Hybrid Test Automation Framework for Urban Ladder ecommerce website is developed using Java, Selenium 4, Page Object Model (POM), Page Factory, TestNG, and Maven. This framework aims to automate the testing process of the website to ensure its functionality, usability, and stability.

### Key Features

1. **Java and Selenium 4**: The framework utilizes Java as the programming language and Selenium 4 as the web automation tool. Selenium 4 provides powerful features for browser automation and interaction.

2. **Page Object Model (POM)**: The framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern, which helps in creating a clear separation between page elements and test logic. Each web page is represented by a separate Page Object Class, making maintenance and updates easier.

3. **Page Factory**: Page Factory is used to initialize web elements in the Page Object Classes, reducing code duplication and improving code readability.

4. **TestNG**: TestNG is used as the testing framework, offering a flexible and robust test structure. It supports parallel test execution, grouping, and test configuration management.

5. **Maven**: Maven is used as the build automation tool for managing project dependencies, building, and packaging the test automation framework.
